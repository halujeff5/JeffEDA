My project talks about a possible dive into the Japanese movie industry by Microsoft. It deals with the popularity and vote average (rating) of Japanese movies versus our entire data set of movies. It shows first that Japanese movies tend to have a lower popularity score than the data set yet still have good ratings from viewers. I derived these descriptive words such as 'good' movie, 'low' popularity, 'high' popularity using the quartile ranges and taking the mean as well. I show that a 'good' movie, a rating of a quartile range above 75% doesn't necessarily yield high popularity. I reasoned, coupled with the fact that 56% of the Japanese market is made of international films that there is not alot of domestic support of homegrown movies. At the end I show that the Japanese language movies are declining in popularity through 2019 and that now is a good time to enter the industry.
